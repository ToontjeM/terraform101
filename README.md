# lacework-terraform-101

This repo contains an introduction to Terraform to get people quickly up to speed and be able to deploy and configure Lacework using Terraform.

For basic introduction to Terraform please follow along the [`BASICS.md`](https://github.com/timarenz/lacework-terraform-101/blob/main/BASICS.md).
If you feel comfortable with that start developing and using [`MODULES.md`](https://github.com/timarenz/lacework-terraform-101/blob/main/MODULES.md).
Last but not least protect your AWS environment using [`LACEWORK.md`](https://github.com/timarenz/lacework-terraform-101/blob/main/LACEWORK.md).

If you find any errors, typos or want to contribute - you are more than welcome.
